# Window-resize
Moving and resizing windows on Windows 11 based on previously saved sizes and positions

A little two way script to save the window configuration of my applications on Windows 11 using pandas and write it to a .csv file.

The same script can be used to restore the saved positions and sizes from a csv file. 

This is quick and dirty and highly specific to my configuration, but could be edited to accept more applications if needed.
